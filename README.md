######  Grammar in use 语法
简单陈述句的语序(Word order in simple statements2) *主语+谓语+宾语+状语*
**主语**一般为名词、代词或名词短语，通常位于**动词**之前。
**动词**必须与**主语**“一致”，所以主语决定动词的单复数形式（如I am, you are, he has）。
**宾语**一般为名词、代词或名词短语。在主动句中，**宾语一般位于动词之后**。

一个句子不总需要有宾语。The man ran away quickly.
那人很快跑掉了。（无宾语）

**状语**的位置比较灵活。

*时间状语可以在句尾，也可以在句首*[1] 
**Last night** Lucy went to the theatre.
昨晚露西去剧院看戏了。
I heard a voice at the door **just now**.
我刚才听到门口有声音。

*当一个句子里有一种以上的副词时，地点副词的一般位置是在方式副词之后、时间副词之前*[2]
She walked very slowly（方式副词） across the stage（地点副词）.  


###### Language points
1. Last week I ***went to the theatre***. 上星期我去看戏。
动词go的原义是离开一个地方去另一个地方，与介词to连用后，常加上主语所要去的目的地来代表主语的动作目的。
go to the +地点　表示去某地干嘛

theatre　 n.剧场，戏剧
cinema:　电影院

课文中go to the theatre = go to the theatre to see a play，即去剧场看戏。
类似的还有go to the cinema = go to the cinema to see a film（去电影院看电影）。

这种表达方式简明扼要。请注意在以下的短语中名词前通常不加冠词：
go to school上学
go to bed上床，睡觉
go to church上教堂，去做礼拜(cf．第1册第68课at school, at church；第1册第85课have been to school/church)

2．had a very good **seat**，座位很好。
seat一般指戏院、汽车等配置的固定座位，也可以抽象地表示“座位”或“位子”的概念：
have a good seat(place)
the front seat of a car 汽车的前座
Take a seat, please.  请就坐

3．The ***play*** was very ***interesting***. 戏很有意思。
interesting属于现在分词形式的形容词，意思是“使人感兴趣”。
它通常与非人称主语连用或修饰某个事物：

4．I did not ***enjoy it***. 
enjoy vt.基本意义为“欣赏”、“享受”、“喜爱”，后面一般跟名词、代词（包括反身代词）或动名词形式。

简不喜欢游泳。她喜欢去剧院看戏。
I enjoy the music.

（2）Enjoy yourself!
好好玩吧！
We always enjoy ourselves.
我们总是玩得很开心。

5．***were sitting*** behind me. They ***were talking*** loudly.……坐在我的身后，大声地说着话。
这两句的时态为过去进行时。（cf．第7课语法）

6．I ***got*** very angry. 我非常生气。
get在这里有“逐渐变得”的含义，接近become，是个表示过程的动词，表示状态的变化。而I was very angry则仅表示当时的状态是生气，并不暗示过程。
got :变得,表示一种变化,got angry
I am/was angry 是一个事实
I got angry:强调变化过程

7．They did not ***pay any attention***.
pay 给予（注意等）；
attention　n. 注意

pay attention :注意
